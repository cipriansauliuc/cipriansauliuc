# 👋 Hi there, I’m Ciprian!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm especially into:

- 🧱 Building interactive web apps with **Angular** & **Babylon.js**
- 🧗‍♂️ Learning, improving, and occasionally hitting bugs with a stick

## 🚧 What I’m working on

Right now, I’m focused on:
- Expanding my **3D visualization** skills
- Staying curious and **learning a bit more every day**

## ✨ Fun facts

- I was born in **Romania** 🇷🇴, but moved to **Spain** 🇪🇸 as a kid and spent most of my life there — now I call **Germany** 🇩🇪 home
- I enjoy movie soundtracks while coding (🎧 *Gladiator* is a favorite)

## 📫 Let's connect!

If you're working on something exciting, or just want to say hi — don’t hesitate!
